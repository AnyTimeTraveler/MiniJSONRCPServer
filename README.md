# MiniJSONRPC 2.0 Server

This is a simple HTTP server that allows you to call any public static method annotated with `@RemoteMethod`.

The aim of this project is to be compatible with [JSON-RPC 2.0 spec](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification).

The project is currently work in progress, but can be used as a base for working with JSON-RPC objects.
